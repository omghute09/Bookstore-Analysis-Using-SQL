📚 Bookstore SQL Practice Project
1) Project Title
Bookstore Database – SQL Query Practice

2) Objectives
- To design and practice SQL queries on a sample bookstore database.
- To strengthen understanding of filtering, aggregation, joins, grouping, and reporting.
- To simulate real-world business questions such as revenue calculation, customer insights, and inventory management.

3) Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench– Relational database management system.
- SQL – Query language for data retrieval and analysis.


4) Key Insights
- Filtering: Retrieve books by genre, publication year, and customers by country.
- Aggregation: Calculate total stock, revenue, and average book prices.
- Ordering & Limits: Identify the most expensive book and lowest stock available.
- Joins & Grouping:
- Find number of books sold per genre.
- Discover most frequently ordered book.
- Track total quantity sold by each author.
- Customer Insights:
- Distinct cities of high-spending customers.
- Identify the customer who spent the most overall.

5) Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to answer practical business questions in a bookstore setting. By practicing queries across multiple categories, learners gain confidence in handling relational databases, extracting insights, and preparing for analyst-level interviews.

Would you like me to also add a visual schema diagram (ERD) section to this README so recruiters can instantly see how books, customers, and orders are connected? That would make the project stand out even more.
